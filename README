This is a simple tool that lists files (regular, dir, symlink) along
with some of their meta-data like size and time stamps, and a hash
value (MD5) of the file contents.  This can be very useful when

- you want to compare files or directories with sub-directories and want
  to see diffs not only in content but also in time stamps.

- you want to compare files on different machines where files are not
  mounted in one machine, where the two machines might not even have
  a network connection to each other.

To use, run lssum on two ore more sets of files and compare the lssum
output.
